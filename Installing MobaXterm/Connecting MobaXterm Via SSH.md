# Here are the steps on how to log in to a Linux instance via MobaXterm using an AWS EC2 instance:

- Launch an EC2 instance in the AWS console.
  
- Once the instance is running, download the key pair (.pem) file associated with the instance.
  
- Open MobaXterm.
  
- Create a new SSH session.
  
- In the Basic SSH settings section, enter the following:

- Remote host: The public IP address of your EC2 instance.
  
- Specify username: The username for your EC2 instance. This is typically ec2-user for Amazon Linux 2 instances and ubuntu for Ubuntu instances.

- In the Advanced SSH settings section, select the Use private key option and browse to the location of your .pem key pair file.
  
- Click OK to save your session settings.
  
- Click Start to connect to your EC2 instance.

- MobaXterm will use the private key (.pem file) you provided to authenticate with the EC2 instance. If everything is set up correctly, you should successfully log in to the Linux instance.
  
- Once you're logged in, you can use the terminal within MobaXterm to interact with your EC2 instance as if you were using a local terminal.


# Here are some additional things to keep in mind:

- Make sure that the .pem key pair file is located in a directory that is accessible to MobaXterm.
  
- If you are using a Mac or Linux machine, you may need to change the permissions on the .pem key pair file so that it is readable by MobaXterm.
  
- If you are having trouble connecting to your EC2 instance, make sure that the public IP address you entered is correct. You can also try restarting your EC2 instance.
