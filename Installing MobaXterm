# Here are the steps on how to install MobaXterm on Windows:
Go to the MobaXterm website: https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/ and download the installer for the Home Edition.
Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
Once the installation is complete, open MobaXterm.
You will see a list of saved sessions in the left-hand column. If you have previously installed and used PuTTY, any saved PuTTY sessions will also be listed.
To create a new session, click on the + button in the top left corner of the window.
In the New Session dialog, enter the hostname or IP address of the remote machine, and select the protocol you want to use (SSH, RDP, VNC, etc.).
Click on the OK button to create the session.
