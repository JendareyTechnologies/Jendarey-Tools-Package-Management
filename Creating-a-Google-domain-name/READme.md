# Here are the steps on how to set up a Google domain name:

- Go to the Google Domains website:
  
https://domains.google/.

- Click Get a new domain.

- Enter the domain name you want to register.

- If the domain name is available, click Buy.

- Enter your contact information and payment details.

- Click Confirm purchase.

# Once your domain name is purchased, you can set up your DNS records. DNS records tell the internet how to find your website. You can do this by following these steps:

- In Google Domains, click your domain name.

- Click DNS.

- Click Add custom name servers.

- Enter the name servers provided by your web hosting provider.
 Click Save.

# It may take some time for your DNS changes to propagate. Once they have propagated, your website will be accessible to the public.

- Here are some additional things to keep in mind when setting up a Google domain name:

- The cost of a domain name depends on the domain extension you choose. For example, a .com domain costs $12/year at Google Domains.

- You can also transfer a domain name that you already own to Google Domains.
